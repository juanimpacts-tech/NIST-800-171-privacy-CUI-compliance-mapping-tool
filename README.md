# NIST-800-171-Privacy-CUI-Compliance-Mapping-Tool

This repository provides a self-contained, instructional lab demonstrating the application of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) methodologies to automate control mapping, perform gap analysis, and evaluate compliance with NIST 800-171 requirements for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
The project simulates a complete compliance evaluation workflow â€” from ingesting mock organizational control data, mapping it to NIST 800-171 requirements, executing automated Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy checks, and generating governance-ready reports. It reflects real-world compliance processes encountered in risk management, security governance, and regulatory assessments.

#Core Functions

1. Map organizational controls to NIST 800-171 requirements.
2. Identify and quantify compliance gaps, with remediation recommendations.
3. Evaluate configurations against defined OPA/Rego policies (remote access, backup protection, access control).
4. Generate professional HTML and PDF compliance reports for stakeholder review.
